sometimes we can't find cors becuase of hidden params. So it can be fixed right away. Just intercept the request in interceptor and send the request containing
a random parameter like "random=1" like https://example.com/api/send?logs=58gdtd73&random=1 or https://example.com/?random=1 and check if the response has 
displayed a header called Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * if it gets displayed then add a header Origin: https://random.com/ in the request and send to see if the 
allowed origin header contains the random.com origin name. Remember you should give the origin name same as the given parameter name. Like if you use parameter name
"hacker=1" then the origin should be hacker.com. And if you make expploit request from foo.com domain then you must provide the parameter name "foo=1"  and Origin: https://www.foo.com"
 suppose your'e exploting the vulnerability or testing the vuln using a github tool then you must provide the parameter name "github=1" and you can give the value 
 whatever you want like "github=hahga7g33" but you must give the name of the domain which you are requesting from. Happy Hacking!!!
